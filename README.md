## About me

Marathon runner, nature lover, and avid reader. 
Currently changing into a web developer career but still giving out cards in the online marketing world. 
Communicating is something that really comes naturally to me. Whether to people or "machines". 
Dynamic, self-starter with a focus on quality outcomes who is always looking for new and valuable experiences where I can learn and contribute to the organization with which I collaborate.

I do love innovation and the tech world. And I do want to have an active role in the development of unique and challenging projects in a multicultural and multidisciplinary work environment.
